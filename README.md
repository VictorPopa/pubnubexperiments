pubnubexperiments
=================

A simple chat app that uses the pubsub features of PubNub.

I use a few libraries with this example: backbone, require, moment, etc.

This is a tiny, tiny application. It doesn't need things like backbone and require.
I used them in part to make sure that I could easily refactor and swap in bits
and pieces to test out. I'm currently barely using Backbone. I don't have models or
even a router in place!

Next up will be to drop in Mocha.js and add some tests.
